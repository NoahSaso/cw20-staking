# Oraiswap Staking

The Staking Contract contains the logic for LP Token staking and reward distribution. Staking rewards for LP stakers come from the new ORAIX tokens generated by Orai multisig contract for each phrase and are split between all combined staking pools. The new ORAIX tokens are distributed in proportion to size of staked LP tokens multiplied by the weight of that asset's staking pool.

# Reward formula

```rust
staker_pending_reward = pool_reward_per_bond * staker_bond_amount
```

where 

```rust
pool_reward_per_bond = pool_reward_per_bond + deposit_reward_amount / pool_total_bond_amount
```

where ```deposit_reward_amount / pool_total_bond_amount``` measures the amount of reward amount a bond unit will receive

initially, ```pool_reward_per_bond``` is 0
